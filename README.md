# STATISTICAL-TESTING
Statistical testing is a method  to determine the likelihood of observing certain patterns, relationships, or differences in a dataset by chance alone. It helps researchers draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. Statistical tests involve mathematical calculations and hypothesis testing to assess the significance of results and make inferences about the underlying population.

## 游릭 TESTS OF HYPOTHESIS BASED ON A SINGLE POPULATION MEAN

The Jupyter notebook 

https://github.com/sidiquegithub/STATISTICAL-TESTING/blob/main/CODE/TESTS%20FOR%20SINGLE%20POPULATION%20MEAN.ipynb 

contains tests on the single population mean, covering the following topics:

#### 游댯 z tests
1.  Normal population with known standard deviation
2. Large Sample Test
3. z tests using in build function

#### 游댯 t tests
1. Small sample test in a normal population
2. t test using in build function

## 游릭 TESTS OF HYPOTHESIS TO COMPARE TWO POPULATION MEANS
The Jupyter notebook 

https://github.com/sidiquegithub/STATISTICAL-TESTING/blob/main/CODE/TEST%20FOR%20TWO%20POPULATION%20MEAN.ipynb 

contains tests to compare two  population means, covering the following topics:

#### 游댯 z tests
1. NORMAL POPULATION WITH KNOWN VARIANCE
2. LARGE SAMPLE TEST
3. Z TEST USING BUID IN FUNCTIONS
     - A) For $H_a:\mu_1-\mu_2 \neq value$
     - B) For $H_a: \mu_1-\mu_2 < value$ Left tail test
     - C) For $H_a: \mu_1-\mu_2 > value$ Right tailed test

####  游댯 t test  
Assume both distributions follows normal distribution, then even for the small samples we can make use of t test

## 游릭 POOLED T TEST FOR POPULATION MEAN

The pooled t-test is used when we have only one sample and make two observations on each subject, resulting in a natural pairing of values. You can find its implementation at the following link:

## 游릭 F- TEST EQUALITY OF VARIANCE

Notes on the F distribution and its application in testing the equality of variances between the two populations.

## 游릭  ANOVA

The analysis of variance, or more briefly ANOVA, refers broadly to a collection of experimental situations and statistical procedures for the analysis of quantitative responses from experimental units.
The simplest ANOVA problem is referred to variously as a single-factor, single-classification, or one-way ANOVA. 

The following contains $One-Way ANOVA$ and $ Two -Way -ANOVA$
